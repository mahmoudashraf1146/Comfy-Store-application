this project represents a store app in which i can choose products to purchase from home page after registering and make sure that i'm logged in. and can check the orders and test the application using the guest user account if i don't want to create an account.
this app was made for practicing HTML, CSS,javascript, and some features in React like Redux, React query, pagination and also working on loaders and actions for dealing with API
